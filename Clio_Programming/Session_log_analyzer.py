# user_id: string
# timestamp: string in ISO 8601 format (e.g., 2025-08-26T13:45:00Z)
# # status: either login or logout 
# Calculate the longest session and which user has that longest session

# Reading file: O(n)

# Sorting sessions per user: O(k log k), where k is number of logs per user

# Total: O(n + uÂ·k log k)

# Space Complexity:

# O(n) for storing all sessions
